# Custom Workspace Switching Shortcut in GNOME

To create a custom shortcut for switching between workspaces in GNOME, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Install Required Tools

Install the necessary tools `wmctrl` and `xdotool` if they are not already installed on your system. These tools are used to manage workspaces and simulate keyboard input.

```bash
sudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool
```

## Step 2: Create a Bash Script

Create a bash script that combines `wmctrl` and `xdotool` to switch between workspaces. You can name the script `switch_workspace.sh` and save it in a convenient location.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current workspace number
current_workspace=$(xdotool get_desktop)

# Calculate the next workspace number
next_workspace=$(( (current_workspace + 1) % $(wmctrl -d | wc -l) ))

# Switch to the next workspace
wmctrl -s $next_workspace
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x switch_workspace.sh
```

## Step 3: Set Up Custom Shortcut

1. Open "Settings" from the Activities Overview or by pressing the Super key and typing "Settings".
2. Select "Keyboard Shortcuts" from the sidebar menu.
3. Scroll down or navigate to the "Custom Shortcuts" section.
4. Click on the "+" button to add a new custom shortcut.
5. Enter a descriptive name for the shortcut, such as "Switch Workspaces".
6. Enter the full path to your script in the "Command" field, e.g., `/path/to/switch_workspace.sh`.
7. Press the desired key combination for the shortcut, e.g., Super + Tab.
8. Click "Add" to save the custom shortcut.

Now, pressing the assigned key combination should switch between workspaces in GNOME.
